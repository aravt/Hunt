<center> <h2> Are you tired of the inefficient and disorganized way of prepping and keepting track of your interviews? </h2> </center>

<center> <h1> Worry no more! With the Hunt app, you have the ability to keep track of your interviews with scheduled reminders along with preperation from actual interviews with the company! </h1> </center>

The purpose of this project is to develop an application which will allow users a better way of organizing their interviews. As students, there are already several assignments to handle due to school; keeping up with interviews can easily become a confusing mess leading student to show up late or unprepared for interviews. The current method is very decentralized where there might be recruitersâ€™ information in one document and the actual dated for events spread out over multiple calendars. In our application, one will be able to log in and see list of all the companies they are currently pursuing. Within a company, they can see a timeline showing where they are in the process and when the next event, they need to worry about is along with more details. There is also a forum filled with crowdsourced information with questions and tips given by other candidates interviewing at the same companies.
